In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models can provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series foundation models.","tags":null,"title":"Pre-trained Forecasting Models: Strong Zero-Shot Feature Extractors for Time Series Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Andreas Auer**, Patrick Podest, Daniel Klotz, Sebastian Böck, Günter Klambauer, Sepp Hochreiter"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1754006400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1754006400,"objectID":"1246809435c9e671144e7f7b81174e2f","permalink":"https://apointa.github.io/publication/2025-tirex.html","publishdate":"2025-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2025-tirex.html","section":"publication","summary":"In-context learning, the ability of large language models to perform tasks using only examples provided in the prompt, has recently been adapted for time series forecasting.

However, they are difficult to apply to time series as the autocorrelative structure of time series violates basic assumptions required by conformal prediction. We propose HopCPT, a novel conformal prediction approach for time series that not only copes with temporal structures but leverages them. We show that our approach is theoretically well justified for time series where temporal dependencies are present.

Most Knowledge Graphs suffer from incompleteness, ie from facts which are valid in the real world that are not represented in the Knowledge Graph at hand. A set of methods to counter this problem are Knowledge Graph Embeddings, which learn vector embeddings for the knowledge graph elements in a way that the underlying structure of the Knowledge Graph is preserved and utilize the learned embeddings to predict missing facts. Knowledge Graph Embeddings show good results but allow only transductive link prediction. In addition their integration of prior information of the entities as well as of temporal information is insufficient and they suffer from scalability problems for large graphs. In this thesis we propose the temporal knowledge graph neural network VT-KGNN. The model overcomes the limitations of Knowledge Graph Embeddings by using a multirelational adaption of local message passing graph neural networks as encoder and a Knowledge Graph Embedding score function as decoder. VT-KGNN especially focuses on the integration of temporal facts, more concretely on facts annotated with a valid time. It does not rely on snapshots but utilizes the temporal information by directly encoding it as a feature used in the Graph Neural Network. The model considers the start and end time of a fact individually, as well as in combination in the form of its duration. In addition it can utilize temporal relationships between facts that share entities","tags":null,"title":"VT-KGNN: A Valid Time Knowledge Graph Neural Network","type":"publication"}]
