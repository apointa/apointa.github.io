Despite significant advances in deep learning based forecasting, practical deployment remains constrained by high operational overhead, including the need for initial training and periodic retraining. Additionally, many use cases lack sufficient task-specific data to train robust models. Furthermore, a forecast’s utility hinges on its reliability, which requires understanding of its inherent uncertainty — a feature often lacking in standard models. This thesis addresses this accessibility gap by developing methods aimed at enhancing the ease-of-use and reliability of forecasting without sacrificing performance. The contributions of this work are organized around two central pillars. The first pillar focuses on enhancing ease-of-use through zero-shot forecasting. By leveraging the paradigm of pre-trained models, we develop methods that can generate accurate forecasts across unknown datasets without requiring any task-specific training. This capability is achieved through in-context learning, where a model dynamically infers the patterns of a provided time series at inference time. We advance this paradigm by introducing COSMIC, a model that effectively incorporates external variables (covariates) in such a zero-shot setting — a crucial capability for real-world forecasting. This capability is instilled during pre-training via a novel augmentation strategy, and allows the model to dynamically infer covariate-target relationships. Further, we present TiRex, a pre-trained model based on xLSTM, which combines state-tracking with strong in-context learning, advancing the performance frontier of zero-shot forecasting. This is facilitated by a novel training paradigm that introduces Contiguous Patch Masking (CPM), alongside a suite of data augmentations, to force the model to rely on its internal state. The second pillar addresses reliability through uncertainty quantification. Recognizing that point forecasts are insufficient for decision-making, we adapt Conformal Prediction, a framework that provides guarantees with minimal assumptions, to the forecasting setting. Our proposed method, HopCPT, conceptualizes a time series as a sequence of recurring regimes and uses a Modern Hopfield Network to learn adaptive, context-aware uncertainty intervals. We extend this with HopCPT-G, which enables the transfer of uncertainty information across multiple related time series to improve predictions for rare events and data-scarce scenarios. In summary, this thesis advances the frontiers of zero-shot forecasting and uncertainty quantification under the unifying goal of accessible forecasting for a broad audience.","tags":null,"title":"Accessible Time Series Forecasting with Deep Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abdul Fatir Ansari","Oleksandr Shchur","Jaris Küken","**Andreas Auer**","Boran Han","Pedro Mercado","Syama Sundar Rangapuram","Huibin Shen","Lorenzo Stella","Xiyuan Zhang","Mononito Goswami","Shubham Kapoor","Danielle C.

However, existing approaches largely focus on univariate forecasting, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where multivariate data and covariates play a crucial role. We present Chronos-2, a pretrained model capable of handling univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks in a zero-shot manner. Chronos-2 employs a group attention mechanism that facilitates in-context learning (ICL) through efficient information sharing across multiple time series within a group, which may represent sets of related series, variates of a multivariate series, or targets and covariates in a forecasting task. These general capabilities are achieved through training on synthetic datasets that impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate series. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art performance across three comprehensive benchmarks: fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II. On fev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting, Chronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over existing models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms baselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains further highlight its practical advantages. The in-context learning capabilities of Chronos-2 establish it as a general-purpose forecasting model that can be used \"as is\" in real-world forecasting pipelines.","tags":null,"title":"Chronos-2: From Univariate to Universal Forecasting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Andreas Auer**, Daniel Klotz, Sebastian Böck, Sepp Hochreiter"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1756684800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1756684800,"objectID":"1a270e88d0523d62dd39ef253026f525","permalink":"https://apointa.github.io/publication/2025-zs-classification.html","publishdate":"2025-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2025-zs-classification.html","section":"publication","summary":"Recent research on time series foundation models has primarily focused on forecasting, leaving it unclear how generalizable their learned representations are. In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models can provide effective representations for classification.

Our experiments show that the best forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series foundation models.","tags":null,"title":"Pre-trained Forecasting Models: Strong Zero-Shot Feature Extractors for Time Series Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Andreas Auer**, Patrick Podest, Daniel Klotz, Sebastian Böck, Günter Klambauer, Sepp Hochreiter"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1754006400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1754006400,"objectID":"1246809435c9e671144e7f7b81174e2f","permalink":"https://apointa.github.io/publication/2025-tirex.html","publishdate":"2025-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2025-tirex.html","section":"publication","summary":"In-context learning, the ability of large language models to perform tasks using only examples provided in the prompt, has recently been adapted for time series forecasting.

Most Knowledge Graphs suffer from incompleteness, ie from facts which are valid in the real world that are not represented in the Knowledge Graph at hand. A set of methods to counter this problem are Knowledge Graph Embeddings, which learn vector embeddings for the knowledge graph elements in a way that the underlying structure of the Knowledge Graph is preserved and utilize the learned embeddings to predict missing facts. Knowledge Graph Embeddings show good results but allow only transductive link prediction. In addition their integration of prior information of the entities as well as of temporal information is insufficient and they suffer from scalability problems for large graphs. In this thesis we propose the temporal knowledge graph neural network VT-KGNN. The model overcomes the limitations of Knowledge Graph Embeddings by using a multirelational adaption of local message passing graph neural networks as encoder and a Knowledge Graph Embedding score function as decoder. VT-KGNN especially focuses on the integration of temporal facts, more concretely on facts annotated with a valid time. It does not rely on snapshots but utilizes the temporal information by directly encoding it as a feature used in the Graph Neural Network. The model considers the start and end time of a fact individually, as well as in combination in the form of its duration. In addition it can utilize temporal relationships between facts that share entities","tags":null,"title":"VT-KGNN: A Valid Time Knowledge Graph Neural Network","type":"publication"}]
