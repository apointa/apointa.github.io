**About me**

Hi, I am Andreas. I am a **PhD student** in the field of **Machine Learning** at the [Institute for Machine Learning](https://ml-jku.github.io/) at Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria, in the Team of Sepp Hochreiter. I am also part of the [ELLIS PhD Program](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc).
Previously, I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees in Computer Science at the Technical University of Vienna.

In my research is am most interested in **Deep Learning** in the context of **Time Series** or more broadly said --- sequential data.
Besides my PhDs focus and motivated by my previous studies (I did a fair amount of Symbolic AI in my bachelor's and master's) and side study (Economics), I am also generally interested in Neuro-Symbolic approaches and in applications in economics/finance.

I have also some experience as professional Software Developer and I believe that readable code is as important as readable papers.
